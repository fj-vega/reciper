# Reciper - Search for recipes

## Description

This project uses the [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/) to look up for healthy recipes. 
Insert your search term and get a list of recipes, then click on 'Check Recipe' (external page) to get detaild info about ingredients and directions.
The website is fully responsive, designed with a mobile first approach and it was created using React and vanilla CSS.

The free API license has a usage limit of 5 requests/minute.
Recipe pages are opened in a new tab by default to persist the search query.
